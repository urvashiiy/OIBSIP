          <p>
            <b>MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI </b>, commonly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful captains in the history of Indian cricket. He was born on July 7, 1981. Dhoni is renowned for his calm and composed demeanor on the field, as well as his exceptional leadership skills.

            He is considered one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen in the world and is known for his powerful hitting, particularly in the limited-overs formats of the game. Dhoni played a pivotal role in India's victory in the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007 and also led the Indian cricket team to a historic ICC Cricket World Cup win in 2011.
            
            Under his captaincy, India achieved several significant milestones, including becoming the top-ranked team in Test cricket for the first time. Dhoni retired from Test cricket in 2014 but continued to play in limited-overs formats.
            
            In August 2020, he announced his retirement from international cricket, marking the end of an illustrious career that spanned over a decade. Dhoni's leadership, exceptional cricketing skills, and contributions to Indian cricket have left a lasting legacy in the sport.
